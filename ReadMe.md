# Say Hello Endpoint
# Design an API endpoint that receives user input and outputs a personalized greeting, such as "Hello, {user's name}." And utilize Postman to facilitate the data retrieval process.


# Peer Reviewer: Caleb Sylvia

# Peer Review: Code is clean and simple. Ran on swagger and Postman, is fully functioning as it should be and gave no issues. Side note you can change the Controller name to be something like sayHello so it corresponds better with the end point.
